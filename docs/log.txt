7/20/18 - Fixed issue with date_watched being saved in dd/mm/yyyy format.

Dates in the m/d/y or d-m-y formats are disambiguated by looking at the separator between the various components: 
if the separator is a slash (/), then the American m/d/y is assumed; whereas if the separator is a dash (-) or a 
dot (.), then the European d-m-y format is assumed.


7/21/18 - Added director to add movie form and saving to the database.

Added uploading of picture when adding movie. Picture is given file name of hash that matches the movie.
Picture file is moved to 'public/uploads/img' dir.
enctype="multipart/form-data" needed to be in the form tag because of the <input type='file'> tag that is used 
for uploading.


7/22/18 - Updated datepicker settings to disable future dates and changed the type to be text input
instead of embedded/inline.

Updated the header.


7/29/18 - Created basic page for movies watched list that queries all movies in the table.


8/2/18 - Updated list items of movies watched to show the rest of the details and the picture of the movie.


8/4/18 - Updated list of movies watched to show date watched with just the date instead of the time appended to the date.
Needed to do date('m-d-Y', strtotime($movie['date_watched'])); Without using strtotime there is a notice warning about the date_watched
because date function needs second parameter to be integer. strtotime converts the string to the correct integer value.


8/10/18 - Made update to save blank notes input as null instead of empty string. Blank form fields that are submitted have an 
empty string value instead of null. Need to do a server side check of required input values and send back errors when needed.

Created xhr call from angular to get list of movies. Will be able to do sorting and filtering and playing with angular now.


9/21/18 - Added sorting to title, director, and date watched columns. Date watched is being sorted incorrectly. 
Need to change format of date or some type of solution.

Altered DB table to have year_released column. Need to update add movie form to use this.


9/23/18 - Added ability to delete movie. 

Currently if there is a sql error the PDOException error will be returned to the modal. Should probably log the error 
somewhere and leave a user friendly error message on the screen.


9/30/18 - Added edit movie page. The form in the page currently fills in all values from selected movie except for 
the picture and date watched.


10/2/18 - Added cancel buttons to add movie and edit movie pages. Added picture to edit movie page. 

On the edit page, the date watched date picker is not being selected. I changed the format of $scope.movie.date_watched to 
use - instead of /, but it is still blank. 


10/6/18 - Continued working on edit page. Created editMovie.php page that edit page post request is sent to. 
Currently, updating one movie will update all the movies.


10/12/18 - Fixed edit page to update only the chosen movie. Added hidden input field to form to send movie id and then
use the movie id in the sql update statement. Needed to use ng-value in the input field to get the id sent:
 <input type="hidden" name="id" ng-value="movie.id">

Need to update so that if there is a picture and a new picture is not selected then the old picture will still be used.
Need to autofill date watched field.


10/16/18 - Started a footer.


10/21/18 - Fixed date_watched field not being autofilled on edit page. 


10/24/18 - Setup version control with git and a remote repository on github.


10/27/18 - Fixed issue with editing movie not saving default image. The uploaded image uses the hash for the filename.
A new hash was being created everytime the movie was edited.


10/31/18 - Started table of random movie images on home page.


11/1/18 - Finished adding table of random movie images to the home page.  


11/3/18 - Updated padding of add and edit movie pages to have right and left margins on smaller browser windows(<992px).
The row class in bootstrap has negative right and left margins of -15. Added 15px margin to main divs on these pages
to offset the negative margins. The tables in the view movies pages have a display property of 'table' that seems to 
offset the row class negative margins.


11/12/18 - Updated submit button on add and edit pages to line up with left side of forms.

Added extra line of text to footer to remove margin under footer on home page in firefox. May do more updates to footer.


11/16/18 - Updated apache settings to point access and error logs to the correct locations.


11/29/18 - Fixed issue where if scrolled down and click on a link the new page would be scrolled down.
Used window.scroll(0, 0) every time a link is clicked.


1/3/19 - Added search box to view movies page using angular filter. Will need to go back to making footer stay on bottom of the page.


1/7/19 - Updated styling of search box and moved it to the right side.


1/8/19 - Updated edit button to have the same width as the delete button. 
Fixed line breaks not showing in description and notes sections. Needed to add the style of "whitespace: pre-line;" to their td's.


1/9/19 - Fixed broken img if movie did not have image uploaded. Used onerror attribute in img src link to point to default image.
Needed to switch from <img src=""> to <img ng-src=""> for this to work.


1/10/19 - Started working on preventing adding a movie if year released field has year input in the future. Form is submitted by php
not angular. Will need to do check in addMovie.php file and return error. Need to update site with error feedback.


1/13/19 - Updated add movie form to not allow the year released field to have a year in the future. I did this by getting the current
year in javascript, attaching it to a variable in scope, and then putting that variable in for the value of the max attribute in the
form.


1/18/19 - Started working on fix for broken image being shown on home page if one of the random selected movies did not have a image
uploaded. Added image_uploaded column to DB table. For the front page random movies only retrieve movies if this column is true.

Currently troubleshooting adding movie and updating this column. It is setting column to 1 when a movie was not uploaded.


1/19/19 - Finished updates for adding a movie with the `image_uploaded` column. To keep this column from being true when no image 
was uploaded I need to check that $_FILES['picture']['name'] != "". The $_FILES['picture']['name'] is always there and will have
an empty string if nothing was uploaded.

Also updated editing movie to use the `image_uploaded` column.

Updated edit page to not show broken link when movie does not have image uploaded. It will show the no image available image.


2/16/19 - Added font awesome icons for edit and delete buttons.


2/26/19 - Started making updates to allow more than one director for a movie. 
Updated DB schema.
    1. Created `directors` table.
    2. Created `directors_movies` table.
    3. Removed `directors` column from `movies` table.

The next step will be to retrieve all directors for each movie. Then display each director when displaying each movie. Will add 
ng-repeat for directors within the ng-repeat of movies.


2/28/19 - Made updates to retrieve all directors by looping through each movie and querying the `directors_moves` and `directors`
table with the matching movie id in `directors_movies` table. Directors are now displayed on view movies page.  


3/1/19 - Added list of directors to add movie page.


3/3/19 - Updating add movie page to have array of directors sent in post request from the checkboxes selected. 

After new row for the new movie is saved need to insert row in `directors_movies` table for each of the directors selected. Need 
the new movie row id for `movie_id` column. The $stmt->execute returns 1 for true. Run query for most recenct row to get movie id?


3/5/19 - Finished saving each director for a new movie by using lastInsertId() function to get the movie id of the last row 
inserted into `movies` table. Looped through the array in $_POST['director'] and saved entry in `directors_movies`.

Need to add ability to add new director. Need to make checking directors into scroll window with possible use of filter search.


3/9/19 - Updated the add movie page to have the directors checkboxes section to use a vertical scroll bar by adding the 
"overflow-y: scroll" style rule.


3/11/19 - Added modal and form to add movie page to add a new director.
Need to write code to save the director to `directors` table.


3/15/19 - Created xhr call from $scope.addDirector() function to call 'addDirector.php' file to save the director to the 
`directors` table. Needed to use the below code to get the data from the http post request because $_POST is not populated.

$postData = file_get_contents("php://input");
$request = json_decode($postData);
if ( isset($request->first_name) ) {
    $firstName = $request->first_name;
}

Also, updated add director modal to have the 'submit' button saved if first name and last name fields are empty.


3/16/19 - Made updates so that after new director is saved the director is returned and added to the $scope.directors 
variable. The new director is being added to the bottom of the list of directors. Need to sort the $scope.directors
by the last name property of each index.


3/17/19 - Added orderBy filter to list of directors in add movie page to put new added director in order in the list.
Reset director data in the form by setting the $scope.director variables to empty strings after the new director is
added.


3/19/19 - Updated edit page to display list of directors and update the `directors_movies` table with the selected
directors. Needed to delete any current records in the `directors_movies` table to prevent any duplicate entries
or leaving a director connected to a movie that was incorrect.

In the list of directors, need to pre select the current directors.


3/22/19 - Made updates on edit movie page to select director in the list. Needed to use call function in controller
to check id of current director in list with array of directors in current movie and if there was a match return 
true to select the checkbox.


3/24/19 - Added manage directors page that list all directors. Sorting by names is working. 

Need to add filter for searching. Need to add functionality to edit and delete buttons.


3/29/19 - Added code to delete director from `directors` table and `directors_movies` table. Code is in place
to call deleteDirector.php file to do the deletions and open success modal or error modal. No testing has 
been done on it yet.


3/30/19 - Tested deleting directors. Fixed wrong rows being deleted from `directors_movies` tables.

Currently after deleting director the director is still listed on the page until refreshing.

For editing director, modals and angular functions have been added. Need to add edit director file to server side.


3/31/19 - Added php code to edit the director. Currently not working there is an issue with the POST data not
being received in the file. The payload is showing up in the HTTP request.


4/3/19 - Fixed editing director not working. Needed to update HTTP POST request content-type to be 
application/x-www-form-urlencoded. The content-type being used was application/json. Also, updated the postData 
variable that sends the payload to be a string with the variables separated by &. Not sure why some of the 
angular $http service post request work the default way. Need to research this more.


4/4/19 - Made updates to add directors in manage directors page. Add search filter to manage directors page.


4/6/19 - Made UI updates. Decreased the width of the add movie, edit movie, and manage directors pages by adding more
padding on the left and right of the main divs. 
Also, on the manage directors page I decreased the width of the last
td that had the action buttons. This td had a lot of space to the right of the buttons. Not sure why. It was not margin.


4/10/19 - Now when deleting movie, the row in `directors_movies` with matching `movie_id` column is also deleted.


4/12/19 - Fixed movies not sorting by date watched by changing date format to be yyyy-mm-dd instead of mm-dd-yyyy.
Moved styles for adding directors div into a class.


4/25/19 - Fixed movies not sorting correctly by director. Needed to update sorting the column to:
    ng-click="sortType='directors[0].last_name';sortReverse=!sortReverse"
This update was needed after updating directors to be added.


5/5/19 - Researched using JS FileReader object to display selected image files on the add movie page.


5/9/19 - Updated add movie form to show image that was selected. Needed to use onchange javascript function in the 
input file tag to call an angular function. Needed to use onchange="angular.element(this).scope().getImageFile(this)"
instead of ng-change because angular does not have a binding for ng-change and the action of selecting a file (file uploaded
control). There is some issue where this option only works in debug mode so I will need to research this more. 

The angular function uses the JS FileReader object to read the contents of the image file and then jquery is used to 
update the src attribute of the img tag.


5/10/19 - Made updates to edit movie page for image displayed to be updated when new image is selected.

Trying to remove the "No File Chosen" message when page is loaded and then update with filename after selecting a file. Currently
The color of the input tag is transparent to not show "No File Chosen" on loading and jquery is used before updating image to
update the css color property of the input tag to black. Right now the first image change does not display the filename any later
image changes will correctly update the color to show the filename. May need to use $apply or $digest in angular to immediately
update the color.


5/11/19 - Continued working on edit movie page when selecting an image.


5/12/19 - Completed updates to edit movie page for selecting an image. Now text next to photo button that said "No File Chosen"
in Chrome or Firefox now is set to transparent color by default to not be visible. As soon as the button is clicked a function
is called that uses jquery to update the color to black to show the text. The onchange event is then called to update the image
on the page to the image that is selected. If selecting a file is canceled, the "No File Chosen" message remains.


5/13/19 - Added a bunch of movies to test displaying image photo on add movie and edit movie page. Found no issues.


5/14/19 - Removed margin-bottom of 25px from #header id selector. That margin was not needed. There is 10px margin-bottom from
the h1 selector from bootstrap.


5/18/19 - Added reports page. This will be updated later with export movies watched to spreadsheet and other various reports or stats.


6/1/19 - Set up gulp to concat files in /src/js/* files to /public/dist/main.js file. Setup gulp watch to do this automatically. 
Also, made a gulp task to minify the concatenated files. The concatenation and minification are working, but the webpage does
not load with the minified version.


6/2/19 - Changed sort type to be date watched with sortReverse variable set to true to show most recently watched movies first.


6/9/19 - Selecting dates on edit page is incorrect. Shows correct date, but when selecting the date picker comes up at 
random times. Clicking away changes date to wrong time.
This probably happened when changing the date format shown on view movies page to "2019-04-21" to fix sorting being incorrect.


6/14/19 - Removed fake contact email from footer. Removed view movies by php query instead of angular div.


6/15/19 - Removed reports page, console.log messages, and unneeded comments in server side code.


6/18/19 - Removed vendor folder from git. Use 'git rm -r --cached vendor' command and added vendor folder to .gitignore file.


8/1/19 - Removed unused movies class file.


8/12/19 - Looked into error with selecting date on edit page being incorrect. Date picker uses "mm/dd/yyyy" format. 
View movies page changes date format to "yyyy-mm-dd" for correct sorting. 


11/24/19 - Fixed error with edit page having wrong date when selecting the date picker. Made changes so that when the edit
button for a movie is click, the date watched string is changed from "yyyy-mm-dd" to "mm/dd/yyyy".

Added the 'movies_watched_app-schema.sql' database schema file to the project.


11/26/19 - Deleted unneeded files. Used "git rm --cached filename" to remove files from repo. Added files to .git/info/exclude 
file to keep locally but not track. Updated .gitignore file.


12/25/19 - Removed images files in 'public/uploads/img' from repo.


1/14/20 - Fixed 'public/uploads/img' folder not being in remote repo. 
Needed to add the following to .gitignore:
public/uploads/img/*
!public/uploads/img/.gitkeep


1/15/20 - Added default task to gulp.


5/31/21 - Fixed issue where home page could show duplicates for the random movie images. Changed query to use
GROUP BY title to prevent duplicates of movies with same title. DISTINCT does not work if multiple columns are queried
and only one column needs to be disctinct.


6/19/21 - Fixed two notices that were occurring in the error log when adding a movie.
1. If the notes of new movie were blank then an undefined variable warning was logged when inserting the movie row.
I added an else condition to set the notes variable to null if the notes field is blank.
2. An "Only variables should be passed by reference" was because of the following line:
    $fileExtension = strtolower(end(explode('.', $_FILES['picture']['name'])));
That line gets the filename, splits the filename into an array of the filename and extension, and uses end to move the 
array pointer to the last index which holds the filename extension.
The error occured because the end function needs to have an array as input instead of a function because it passes the
array input by reference.
I broke up the line of code to the following:
    $fileNameParts = explode('.', $_FILES['picture']['name']);
    $fileExtension = strtolower(end($fileNameParts));

Made updates for when deleting a movie that movie's image file is also deleted.


6/22/21 - Updated footer to stay on bottom of page when there is not enough content on the page to fill the viewport.
Also updated the background color and top padding to center footer text.


6/28/21 - Centered text in 404 error document page.


6/29/21 - Fixed footer text and body content shifting when opening bootstrap modal. This was happening on manage directors
page and view movies page. Clicking removed scrollbar and added padding-right 17px to body. Updated style.css for 
modal-open class to inherit overflow and for padding-right to be 0 with the !important rule to stop overriding.
