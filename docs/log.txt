7/20/18 - Fixed issue with date_watched being saved in dd/mm/yyyy format.

Dates in the m/d/y or d-m-y formats are disambiguated by looking at the separator between the various components: 
if the separator is a slash (/), then the American m/d/y is assumed; whereas if the separator is a dash (-) or a 
dot (.), then the European d-m-y format is assumed.


7/21/18 - Added director to add movie form and saving to the database.

Added uploading of picture when adding movie. Picture is given file name of hash that matches the movie.
Picture file is moved to 'public/uploads/img' dir.
enctype="multipart/form-data" needed to be in the form tag because of the <input type='file'> tag that is used 
for uploading.


7/22/18 - Updated datepicker settings to disable future dates and changed the type to be text input
instead of embedded/inline.

Updated the header.


7/29/18 - Created basic page for movies watched list that queries all movies in the table.


8/2/18 - Updated list items of movies watched to show the rest of the details and the picture of the movie.


8/4/18 - Updated list of movies watched to show date watched with just the date instead of the time appended to the date.
Needed to do date('m-d-Y', strtotime($movie['date_watched'])); Without using strtotime there is a notice warning about the date_watched
because date function needs second parameter to be integer. strtotime converts the string to the correct integer value.


8/10/18 - Made update to save blank notes input as null instead of empty string. Blank form fields that are submitted have an 
empty string value instead of null. Need to do a server side check of required input values and send back errors when needed.

Created xhr call from angular to get list of movies. Will be able to do sorting and filtering and playing with angular now.


9/21/18 - Added sorting to title, director, and date watched columns. Date watched is being sorted incorrectly. 
Need to change format of date or some type of solution.

Altered DB table to have year_released column. Need to update add movie form to use this.


9/23/18 - Added ability to delete movie. 

Currently if there is a sql error the PDOException error will be returned to the modal. Should probably log the error 
somewhere and leave a user friendly error message on the screen.


9/30/18 - Added edit movie page. The form in the page currently fills in all values from selected movie except for 
the picture and date watched.


10/2/18 - Added cancel buttons to add movie and edit movie pages. Added picture to edit movie page. 

On the edit page, the date watched date picker is not being selected. I changed the format of $scope.movie.date_watched to 
use - instead of /, but it is still blank. 


10/6/18 - Continued working on edit page. Created editMovie.php page that edit page post request is sent to. 
Currently, updating one movie will update all the movies.


10/12/18 - Fixed edit page to update only the chosen movie. Added hidden input field to form to send movie id and then
use the movie id in the sql update statement. Needed to use ng-value in the input field to get the id sent:
 <input type="hidden" name="id" ng-value="movie.id">

Need to update so that if there is a picture and a new picture is not selected then the old picture will still be used.
Need to autofill date watched field.


10/16/18 - Started a footer.


10/21/18 - Fixed date_watched field not being autofilled on edit page. 


10/24/18 - Setup version control with git and a remote repository on github.


10/27/18 - Fixed issue with editing movie not saving default image. The uploaded image uses the hash for the filename.
A new hash was being created everytime the movie was edited.

10/31/18 - Started table of random movies images on home page.
